docs: Reorganize project structure for clarity and maintainability

Major structural improvements to make the project easier to navigate:

📚 Documentation Organization
- Created docs/ folder to centralize all documentation
- Moved backend docs to docs/backend/
- Added docs/README.md as documentation hub
- Created PROJECT_MAP.md for quick navigation
- Created STRUCTURE.md for visual hierarchy
- Added ORGANIZATION_SUMMARY.md detailing changes

🔧 Scripts Organization
- Moved utility scripts from supabase/ to scripts/
- Better separation of concerns (code vs scripts)

📱 Code Organization
- Created src/index.ts with centralized exports
- 11 well-organized export sections
- Beautiful ASCII art structure
- Comprehensive usage examples

🧹 Cleanup
- Removed duplicate env.example file
- Updated README.md with documentation links
- Cleaned .env.example

Benefits:
✅ All docs in one place (docs/)
✅ Easy navigation (PROJECT_MAP.md)
✅ Clear structure (STRUCTURE.md)

✅ Better onboarding for new developers
✅ Professional project organization
