## Location Permissions Explained

### Why We Need "Always Allow"
Calybr needs background location access to:
1. **Automatically detect** when you start driving (hands-free experience)
2. **Record complete trips** without you having to open the app
3. **Calculate accurate scores** based on your entire trip

### Your Control
- You can disable automatic trip detection in Settings
- Location tracking only happens during trips (not 24/7)
- You can view all recorded trips and delete any you don't want

### Battery Impact
We've optimized location tracking to minimize battery usage, but background tracking does use some battery. Most users see minimal impact.
